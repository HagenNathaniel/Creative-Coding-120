# Creative-Coding-120

(will be redone in atom at a later time, just using as a 'copy and paste' repository).
Homework for Creative Coding 1


Things learned this week:

this week, we were turned loose on designing our first sketch, without the instructor's step by step guides. For me, it was mostly easy, but I ran into problems with previewing what my code would produce. 

Problems encountered:

I encountered a few issues, mostly with previewing, and learning new syntax for shapes, colors, and x and y coordinates. Got help from students via the issues forum, and also, face to face this week. The fact I was also caught up in studying for an exam in another course, cut into my time here, as well as personal life things at home, didn't help matters much...so I got started late.

Helped any students with their projects?: 

Honestly, I don't recall seeing any issues pertaining to this week's workload, so this would be a no.

Things you'd like to learn more about:

MY main problem this time was the fact I could NOT get atom to allow a "preview" in the program itself for this sketch, was thinking it was due to the fact it wasn't HTML or anything. But I am not sure how to "learn" more about this subject.
