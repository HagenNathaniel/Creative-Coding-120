Weeks' work:

This week's work, for me, consisted of, mostly "WHAT WAS I THINKING?" I had such a brain fart most of the week, I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong, only to find out, towards the end, it was ONE FREAKING capital letter that choked my code...

All jokes aside, this was the first week we were turned loose by the instructor, to do our own sketches, with NO real instructions or files to use, we were on our own. It was a fun excercise, and I got all kinds of tingly excited as I was successful in getting EACH line to work, and coding has RARELY had that effect on me..

Steps taken to finish assignment:

I decided the best way to tackle this assignment, is to create a new folder, using the blank files from the previous assignment. And then modify the code, so instead of it saying "hello World," it was a (albeit silly looking) monster.

Initially, I wrote up all the code, and was intending to use a preview window to adjust the size and position of each shape after the code was found to work....It didn't work out right, and for a long while, I had trouble figuring out why, until someone in the issues forum noticed a syntax error (that afformentioned missing capital letter) in my code, which was causing the preview window to NOT show anything but a blank screen.

Once that issue was ironed out, it took me a bit of time to fix the positioning and sizes of the shapes that composed the monsters' body.

What issues did you encounter:

As I mentioned above, the issue I had, that took almost the whole time I had to do this assignment, and once that problem was solved, I was able to finish the rest of the assignment with relative ease.

 Any Further learning you would like to explore:

Actually, no, there isn't, most of anything I would want to learn, would be best explored by myself, when I EVER get any time to do so.

Fellow students issues you helped solve:

This week, there wasn't anything to solve that I could see, besides my issue, which was helped easily, it was in the "study group" forum.
