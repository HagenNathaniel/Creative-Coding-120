Final Project Proposal!!


My proposal for this project is an " interactive trivia question" game, with a series of questions pertaining to either pop
culture references, or gaming questions. it will utilize backgrounds, photos, videos (if time and troubleshooting allows) pertaining to the
material in the Game.

My inspiration for this idea, comes from my first year of Java class with  Professor Steven Stiff of Missoula College. I did a similar thing
as an assignment there, and I want to try my hand at doing it in a more "interesting" way, since then it was just a "non-interactive" program.

Potential problems I will be solving include: Programming in such a way that it 'stops' until the correct answer is given, inserting outside
media into the game, such as videos and photos, as well as figuring out which would be most effective to run the program, for loops, or if/else 
statements. Having backgrounds that change depending on correct/incorrect answers, as well as building my first 'fully interactive' javascript 
program.

My timeline is as follows: Week 1, preliminary design setup, with POSSIBLE start on coding the first part of the project. Week 2, Code SHOULD be
coming along a bit more at this stage, Perhaps some code for question(s) posted on help forum to iron out any 'kinks' found/encountered along
the way. Final push, Polish code, comment it, test it, and submission.

Work completed this week towards the goal: Discussed my idea with family, who think it was a good idea, started mentally coding the initial design,
asked the class what they thought of my ideas on implementation (still waiting on a response there), and started if anything I have learned
would be useful, and where, and what I would need to research in order to continue the project.
