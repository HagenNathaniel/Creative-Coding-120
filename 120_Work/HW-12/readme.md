# HW-12 Readme.md


This week was about interaction between objects and classes. I really enjoyed it.

My initial thought was to create a sketch with balls that are bouncing off each other and the canvas, after doing some looking around, I found you could get the balls to change colors at impact, and decided to add that in, to make it look much less 'meh.'

Problems?: I did have a few, but was able to iron them out enough to get the code running. It came down to a missing bracket at the end as the main issue.

Did you help a student?: No, most of their questions were answered before I could.

anything you'd like to learn more about?: No, I think I am getting it, slowly.
