What was this weeks' workflow: This week we played with functions!! (and arrays, can't forget those).

I had some issues with some code I modified to change the output look, but
with a little bit of troubleshooting, some time, and experimentation, I
was able to get them running, although not all my changes worked..

Any issues you helped others with: No, by the time I saw them, (I worked most of the weekend) they were resolved.
Anything you'd like to explore further: Honestly, I can't think of any. I would love to learn more about
ways to use arrays though, especially from user input!

NOTE ON CODE: If you use a popup blocker, it may disable the last function in the program!
