What was this weeks' workflow: This week was relatively laid back, we were given VERY liberal instructions and some instructions that left the door WIDE open for interpretation.

Honestly, the issues I encountered were mostly syntax related. I was able to write the program with decent ease. And took to the issues forum to help get my issues resolved. I was having issues getting my variable to be stored, my if else statement to run correctly, and a minor mmistake in my fixing of the previous errors that caused the program to fail to run as intended.

Any issues you helped others with: No, the issues I saw, were resolved too quickly for me to get a word in edgewise.

Anything you'd like to explore further: In fact, there IS something I would love to explore more, more ways to do if else statements, like having a THIRD option for a greater than, or less than statement. I used only two in mine.
