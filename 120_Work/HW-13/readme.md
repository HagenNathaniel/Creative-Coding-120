## where did the idea come from?

As a gamer, it was no surprise I decided to try my hand at making a game, although it probably won't be
contending with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 anytime soon HA!

I am also a HUGE nerd, and my knowledge of seemingly useless, and random things is legendary..

So I thought, "why not a trivia game, based on my love of games and TV shows?" The rest, as they say, is history!

## Design Process

My process began in mid November, when I first saw the instructions for the final project. At first it seemed like I should do something 'not so crazy.' But I didn't want to do something easy. My instructor, during a hands on help session for the project, had alluded to the fact that "games are hard, so much logic," and that was when I started worrying that I had bitten off a bigger chunk than I could chew.

However, prior to that help session, I had found a similar project, in a tutorial online. That project used OOP (object Oriented Programming), to achieve similar goals...What I found humorous was, IT DIDN'T work if you tried it!!

## Triumphs and excitement!! With Production process

I adapted the code to use P5.js and HTML code, and had made a LOT of progress on my own, but wanted a second opinion, as well as some pointers on where to go from there...Which is why I reached out to the instructor, as well as my fellow classmates, who have proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in previous projects during the course, and they didn't dissappoint me this time either. It turned out, that my code was 100% sound, so far, and functioned as it should, given the instructions I had written in the program! With their combined help and assistance, I was able to get a staggering amount of the program done! The final pieces came in the form of a collaborative effort between a close friend in the coding world, and me. I bounced ideas off him, and he helped me make them work! When we finished, and the code ran almost FLAWLESSLY, we were BOTH exstatic, and excited! There are some parts that aren't fully working, and some of my design ideas turned out not to work at all like they should have, but the underlying program works VERY well! (I will outline my other ideas as 'failures' below).

When my friend and I started working together to finish the last bit of the game, it was down to a few final hurdles: Get the questions to display, get the score to display, as well as format that display correctly. And, after MUCH trial and error, we succeeded! For whatever reason, the array for the questions stops at question 9, a fact neither one of us could figure out why it was happening, but we worked up until 1AM the night before it was due, to try to get it working. To no avail, sadly.

## Failures (or things that weren't to be).........

Nothing ever works 100% like you want it to, and this project was no exception.

1. I was trying to incorporate a picture into the program in some manner, but...no matter how many times I tried, EVEN with the course website step by step, it just didn't 'load' at all...so that idea was scrapped towards the end.

2. I wanted to have a button that closed the tab the game was running on, when you pressed a button on the screen, but found out from the Instructor, that that requires 'low level' operating system access, and browsers and OS's tend to block that functionality for security reasons. it CAN be done, but is beyond what this class entails, so that idea was shelved as well.

3. As mentioned above, the questions don't display all 10 of them during the course of the game. Me and my friend tried to get it all working until the wee hours of the morning, and tried EVERYTHING we could think of, but it still didn't work correctly. So the questions stop at number 9, I consider that a 'quasi' failure, of sorts.

### All in all...

This project, not to mention this course, has given me more confidence in my amateur abilities as a program designer and coder. I have had a LOT of bad experiences in other courses, which handicapped me SEVERELY coming into Creative Coding 1. This course has made me feel like I am not as worthless at coding as my previous experiences had, in Java and C/C++. The instructor is enthusiastic, informative, and extremely helpful for those of us 'newbs' in the field. I look forward to going further from here, and expanding my knowledge in Coding, and program design!
