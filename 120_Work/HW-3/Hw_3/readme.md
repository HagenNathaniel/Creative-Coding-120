["Hello World!" Sketch](https://hagennathaniel.github.io/Creative-Coding-120/120_Work/HW-3/Hw_3/)

## Weeks' Work

 This week's work was, initially easy for me to do, I spent a LOT of time looking at the example code, before I could figure out what was going wrong with mine. And when it was done, I had some issues getting the sketch itself to load, more on that below. The choices I made, were mostly on formatting the words "Hello World" to be centered on the screen canvas I created, which was 1280x720px in size, and that part took me the longest time, I got it as close as I could in the end, and liked how it turned out.

## Steps taken to complete assignment:

 First steps I took to complete the assignment, was to follow along with the examples, after I got mostly comfortable with that, I started messing around with some designs of my own, before deciding on my final result. I would have done some ellipses around the "Hello World" text, if I had had the time left over to do it, but the aforementioned issue I had ate the time I had left to do so.. Second step I took was to decide on a background, I inititally wanted to do the # fae color, but it was too odd of a color, and my eyes didn't appreciate it much..Third step was to get the repo to act like a website, which, as you'll see later, was a 6-7 hour fight.

 ## Any issues you had:

 As mentioned before, I had an issue with my website returning false information, which, I posted about on the "issues" page in the course github site. After going back and forth with a fellow student, it turned out to be a combination of my browser's cache being messed up, and perhaps (not totally sure), some misspellings/capitalization issues in my URL I used to test the site. The fellow student (DVSnell in github) was MORE than helpful, and I was able to troubleshoot the issue and finish my tests, which was a success. As stated before, I had further plans on the project, but I also felt it would be too much, too soon, in this class, and would probably turn into a pain in the rear for me..and was probably not what the instructor wanted anyway.

 ## further learning on a subject learned this week:

 There is one thing, I had some issues with creating my folders in the repository..As you'll probably notice, my folder setup in my repository is VERY long..and didn't need to be. I chalked that up to my own ineptitude as a beginning github user, so maybe there's nothing I can learn further there. /shrug

## Fellow student Issues:

 An issue I attempted to fix from a fellow student, was a student who was having a similar problem with her site, as I did.. I inquired as to whether it could be seen in her desktop/github website repository (going from my own recollection here, might be worded slightly wrong), my thought was, if there was an error in her website's appearance, or how it loaded, it might have been a similar problem to mine, a simple case of "bad grammar."
