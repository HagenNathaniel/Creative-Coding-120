This weeks' work entailed our first foray into animation, I went with something rather fun, and silly..A coin that follows the cursor and refreshes every 12 frames. Rather simplistic, but it served the purpose. My initial thought was a clock in the center of the screen, that had the hour and minute hands follow the direction of the mouse's movement, but that was quickly discounted, due to the fact I felt it was 'too complex' for my current skill level, and would be too frustrating due to that, so I changed my idea to "falling money." I WAS gonna add the saying 'Time is Money Friend,' at the bottom, which is a reference to one of my all time favorite games, World of Warcraft, but couldn't manage to get it to work, so removed it from the code string.

Issues encountered: I honestly didn't have any this go around. I stumbled on the ability to offset the placement of an object NEAR the cursor, so it was where I wanted it, but would still follow the cursor. I didn't find it on any website, I just thought to myself, "I wonder if I can do this!!?" "Well, that's cool!", and it came in handy several times later in the project.

Any issues you helped others with: I did not see any that really needed my input, so on that score, no.

Anything you'd like to explore again: not really, this week's material was easy enough to grasp.
